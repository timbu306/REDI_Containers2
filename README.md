# ðŸš€ Explore Kubernetes Beyond Basics â€” Fun Self-Study Activity

Welcome to your last Cloud Infrastructure session! You've done great with Minikube. Now let's explore Kubernetes components a bit deeper to see how real cloud applications run and scale. This activity takes about **60-90 minutes** and builds your confidence with Kubernetes concepts by practical, hands-on steps.

---

## Step 1: Review Your Minikube Cluster Status (5 min)

Let's start your Kubernetes cluster and check that everything is ready.

**Run this to start Minikube:**

```bash
minikube start
```

**Check the status of your cluster:**

```bash
minikube status
```

### Why?
This starts your tiny Kubernetes cloud on your computerâ€”it's your little mini data center. Verifying the status ensures your Kubernetes brain (control plane) and worker nodes (where containers run) are ready.

---

## Step 2: Deploy a Simple Application with Labels (15 min)

Deploy the nginx web server like before, but now add a label to the deployment.

```bash
kubectl create deployment webserver --image=nginx:latest --labels="app=webserver,env=dev"
```

**Check the pods and their labels:**

```bash
kubectl get pods --show-labels
```

### Why?
Labels are important to organize and manage your apps inside Kubernetes. They act like name tags telling Kubernetes which objects belong together, helping with updates, scaling, and monitoring.

---

## Step 3: Create a Service to Access Your App (10 min)

Expose your deployment so you can open the web server in your browser.

```bash
kubectl expose deployment webserver --type=NodePort --port=80
```

**Get the URL to open the web server:**

```bash
minikube service webserver --url
```

Open the URL in your browser.

### Why?
Services expose your app inside and outside Kubernetes. The NodePort service makes your app reachable from your computer's web browser. This mimics how web apps are accessible on the internet.

---

## Step 4: Scale Your Application (10 min)

Let's make your app handle more visitors by increasing the number of webserver pods.

```bash
kubectl scale deployment webserver --replicas=4
```

**Check that 4 pod copies are running:**

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

### Why?
Scaling means running multiple copies (pods) of your app for more reliability and capacity. Kubernetes automatically balances traffic between these copies, like many shop assistants helping customers.

---

## Step 5: Rolling Updates â€” Upgrade Your App Without Downtime (20 min)

Apply an update to your app by switching the nginx image version.

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/webserver nginx=nginx:1.23
```

**Watch the update rolling out gracefully:**

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/webserver
```

### Why?
Rolling updates let you upgrade apps without interruption. Kubernetes replaces old pods with new ones one by one, so the app stays available continuously.

---

## Step 6: Inspect Logs and Connect to Your App (15 min)

**Find your pod name:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=webserver -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}"
```

**Check logs of the pod:**

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

**Connect inside the pod's container:**

```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh
```

**Inside, list nginx web files:**

```bash
ls /usr/share/nginx/html
exit
```

### Why?
Logs help you understand what the app is doing and where errors might happen. Exec lets you jump inside a running app to troubleshoot or explore the file system â€” essential for real-world cloud operators.

---

## Step 7: Cleanup (5 min)

When done, delete your app and stop Kubernetes:

```bash
kubectl delete service webserver
kubectl delete deployment webserver
minikube stop
```

### Why?
Clean environments keep your computer tidy and ensure no leftover resources consume memory or CPU.

---

## Extra Challenge (Optional)

Try editing the nginx HTML page inside the pod by using `kubectl exec` to open a shell, then modify files with basic Linux commands (`echo`, `cat`). Or, try deploying a different app from Docker Hub!
