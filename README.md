# ðŸš€ Explore Kubernetes Beyond Basics â€” Fun Self-Study Activity

Welcome to your last Cloud Infrastructure session! You've done great with Minikube. Now let's explore Kubernetes components a bit deeper to see how real cloud applications run and scale. This activity takes about **60-90 minutes** and builds your confidence with Kubernetes concepts by practical, hands-on steps.

---

## Step 1: Review Your Minikube Cluster Status (5 min)

Let's start your Kubernetes cluster and check that everything is ready.

ðŸ“š **Learn more:** [Minikube Documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) | [Kubernetes Cluster Architecture](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/)

**Run this to start Minikube:**

```bash
minikube start
```

**Check the status of your cluster:**

```bash
minikube status
```

### Why?
This starts your tiny Kubernetes cloud on your computerâ€”it's your little mini data center. Verifying the status ensures your Kubernetes brain ([control plane](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#control-plane-components)) and worker nodes ([where containers run](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/)) are ready.

---

## Step 2: Deploy a Simple Application with Labels (15 min)

Deploy the [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) web server like before, but now add a label to the deployment.

ðŸ“š **Learn more:** [Kubernetes Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) | [Labels and Selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) | [Nginx on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx)

```bash
kubectl create deployment webserver --image=nginx:latest --labels="app=webserver,env=dev"
```

**Check the pods and their labels:**

```bash
kubectl get pods --show-labels
```

### Why?
[Labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) are important to organize and manage your apps inside Kubernetes. They act like name tags telling Kubernetes which objects belong together, helping with updates, scaling, and monitoring.

---

## Step 3: Create a Service to Access Your App (10 min)

Expose your deployment so you can open the web server in your browser.

ðŸ“š **Learn more:** [Kubernetes Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) | [Service Types (NodePort, ClusterIP, LoadBalancer)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types)

```bash
kubectl expose deployment webserver --type=NodePort --port=80
```

**Get the URL to open the web server:**

```bash
minikube service webserver --url
```

Open the URL in your browser.

### Why?
[Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) expose your app inside and outside Kubernetes. The [NodePort](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport) service makes your app reachable from your computer's web browser. This mimics how web apps are accessible on the internet.

---

## Step 4: Scale Your Application (10 min)

Let's make your app handle more visitors by increasing the number of webserver pods.

ðŸ“š **Learn more:** [Scaling Applications](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#scaling-a-deployment) | [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) | [Horizontal Pod Autoscaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/)

```bash
kubectl scale deployment webserver --replicas=4
```

**Check that 4 pod copies are running:**

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

### Why?
[Scaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#scaling-a-deployment) means running multiple copies ([pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)) of your app for more reliability and capacity. Kubernetes automatically balances traffic between these copies, like many shop assistants helping customers.

---

## Step 5: Rolling Updates â€” Upgrade Your App Without Downtime (20 min)

Apply an update to your app by switching the nginx image version.

ðŸ“š **Learn more:** [Rolling Updates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/update/update-intro/) | [Deployment Strategies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#strategy) | [Rollback](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#rolling-back-a-deployment)

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/webserver nginx=nginx:1.23
```

**Watch the update rolling out gracefully:**

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/webserver
```

### Why?
[Rolling updates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/update/update-intro/) let you upgrade apps without interruption. Kubernetes replaces old pods with new ones one by one, so the app stays available continuously.

---

## Step 6: Inspect Logs and Connect to Your App (15 min)

ðŸ“š **Learn more:** [Logging Architecture](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/) | [kubectl logs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#logs) | [kubectl exec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#exec) | [Debugging Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/debug-running-pod/)

**Find your pod name:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=webserver -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}"
```

**Check logs of the pod:**

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

**Connect inside the pod's container:**

```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh
```

**Inside, list nginx web files:**

```bash
ls /usr/share/nginx/html
exit
```

### Why?
[Logs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/) help you understand what the app is doing and where errors might happen. [Exec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/get-shell-running-container/) lets you jump inside a running app to troubleshoot or explore the file system â€” essential for real-world cloud operators.

---

## Step 7: Cleanup (5 min)

When done, delete your app and stop Kubernetes:

```bash
kubectl delete service webserver
kubectl delete deployment webserver
minikube stop
```

### Why?
Clean environments keep your computer tidy and ensure no leftover resources consume memory or CPU.

---

## Extra Challenge (Optional)

Try editing the nginx HTML page inside the pod by using `kubectl exec` to open a shell, then modify files with basic Linux commands (`echo`, `cat`). Or, try deploying a different app from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)!
